```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## The Idea

```{r packages, comment = " "}
library(ggplot2)
```

**Our Idea**: Allowing users to play around with common probability distributions will aid their understanding of those distributions.

## The Implementation

- Our app has 3 panels - one for each of the following distributions:

  - **Normal**
  - **Uniform**
  - **Poisson**
  
- In each panel, we provide options for the user to play around with the distribution
- The changes are implemented when the user clicks the **Display** button

## The Options

The options that the user can change for each distribution are as follows:

- **Normal**: Number of observations, mean, standard deviation

- **Uniform**: Number of observations, minimum value, range of the distribution

- **Poisson**: Number of observations, lambda

## Sample App Output

We show one of the many possible outputs displayed by our app below - this is for a **Normal** distribution with a mean of 10, a standard deviation of 5, and 100 observations.

```{r plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data.frame(Histogram = rnorm(100,10,5)), aes(Histogram)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, boundary = 0,
                       fill = "white", color = "seagreen4")
```
